# Cloudflare R2 File Uploader

Simple demonstration on uploading and storing large files to Cloudflare Buckets using Cloudflare Worker bindings and AWS SDK S3 API.

## What is R2?

R2 is an object storage platform that can serve as a drop-in replacement for AWS S3, without the egress bandwidth charges of a typical cloud storage provider, with an S3-compatible API.

R2 is still under development. Author, however, was granted closed beta access to the platform on April 22, 2022.
